# Introduction to Property Graphs

> Proposed online tutorial for [SWIB2024 conference](https://swib.org/swib24/)

Property Graphs are a powerful and flexible data structure used to represent relationships and properties based on graphs.
The tutorial will give an introduction to property graphs including a comparision with RDF and how to map between both
data structuring languages. After basic definition of property graphs and their elements we will look at examples and
practical applications as well as tools and technologies such as graph database management systems and visualization tools.
The workshop will include exercises using an online graph database and introduction to the query language CYPHER and to the
property graph exchange format PG. Data modeling with property graphs is shown and compared to RDF with
each of its advantages and limitations.

The tutorial is planned for half a day (3 hours plus breaks).
